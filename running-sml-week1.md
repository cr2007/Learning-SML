1. remote login to your university account (or do whatever you usually do to get to the university machines, or if you have SML on your own computer then do the work on your own computer).

2. On university linux machines, in the same directory in which you have the file [`sml-week1.sml`](sml-week1.sml), type the following line (and hit `return`):

```shell
sml
```

Then: type the following line and hit return
```sml
use "sml-week1.sml";
```

If you want, read and understand the messages you get, but don't bother if you don't want to, or you think you don't understand.

The instructions under 2, change if you are using a windows machine. <br>
You should use a linux machine.  For a window machine, perhaps the following will work for you:

- open the SMLNJ app and type
```sml
use C:\\....\\sml-week1.sml
```

But, I repeat, you should use the **linux machines**. If your laptop is based on windows, log remotely into the universities linux machines.

3. Type the following and hit return

```sml
printLEXP vx;
```

See what you get.

4.  type the following and hit return
```sml
printLEXP t1;
```

See what you get.

5.  type the following and hit return
```sml
printLEXP t9;
```

See what you get.

6. Check it out like above for all the terms `vx`, `vy`, `vz`, `t1`, ... `t9`, print them and see what you get.

7. type  the following and hit `return`
```sml
is_var vx;
```

See what you get.

8. type  the following and hit `return`
```sml
is_var t9;
```

See what you get.

9. Check it out like above for all the terms `vx`, `vy`, `vz`, `t1`, ... `t9`, to check  them if they are a variable and see what you get.

10. type  the following and hit `return`

```sml
addbackapp [vx] t1;
```

See what you get.

11. Practice with adding a term to the back of a list of terms as above on your choice of terms and lists.  Check the result and think.

12. Do the same as above but add front app instead of add back app.

13. Do the same as above but using addlam and practice practice and think.

14. run `printlistreduce` on a list of terms and see what you get. For example:
```sml
printlistreduce [t1, t2, t3, t4];
```

gives the following:
```sml
(\x.x)-->(\y.x)-->(((\x.x) (\y.x)) z)-->((\x.x) z)val it = () : unit
```


15. practice, practice, practice by playing with the above.

16. Write new terms other than the `vx`, `vy`, `vz`, `t1`, .. `t9` I give and run the above questions on your new terms.


Once you finish working, type "`control-D`"  to exit sml.

I hope you enjoyed it.  Keep practicing like this since you will need to use this material in your assignment.
